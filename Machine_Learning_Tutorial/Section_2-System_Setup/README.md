The Vitis unified software platform enables the development of embedded software and accelerated applications on heterogeneous Xilinx platforms including FPGAs, SoCs, and Versal ACAPs. It provides a unified programming model for accelerating Edge, Cloud, and Hybrid computing applications. Leverage integration with high-level frameworks, develop in C, C++, or Python using accelerated libraries or use RTL-based accelerators & low-level runtime APIs for more fine-grained control over implementation — Choose the level of abstraction you need.
